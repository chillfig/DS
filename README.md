# core Flight System (cFS) Data Storage Application (DS)

## Introduction

The Data Storage application (DS) is a core Flight System (cFS) application 
that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (cFE) component of the cFS.  
The DS application is used for storing software bus messages in files. These 
files are generally stored on a storage device such as a solid state recorder 
but they could be stored on any file system. Another cFS application such as 
CFDP (CF) must be used in order to transfer the files created by DS from 
their onboard storage location to where they will be viewed and processed.

The DS application is written in C and depends on the cFS Operating System
Abstraction Layer (OSAL) and cFE components.  There is additional DS application
specific configuration information contained in the application user's guide.

Developer's guide information can be generated using Doxygen:
```
  make prep
  make -C build/docs/ds-usersguide ds-usersguide
```

## Software Required

cFS Framework (cFE, OSAL, PSP)

An integrated bundle including the cFE, OSAL, and PSP can
be obtained at https://github.com/nasa/cfs

## About cFS

The cFS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and
set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data
systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.  More
information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov
